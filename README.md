# Measurement-of-key-parameters-of-wing-vibration-modulus
The project goal is to use binocular vision and non-contact measurement methods to identify modal parameters of large antennas, solar wings, etc. in orbit. 
The rar compressed file contains two folders. One folder has a chessboard for camera calibration, and the other folder has feature points, split into left and right images, for measurement purposes.
